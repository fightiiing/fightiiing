### ðŸ‘‹
In March 2023 I finished a four month, full-time, instructor-led bootcamp on front-end web development. The focus was on React, but we also covered back-end, mainly with Java and Spring. This is after about ten years professionally working via a CMS to update, maintain, and help design webpages in my last position. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... expanding my React projects by introducing more advanced features. My final React project from the course was the Superhero App that I have pinned. I'm also working on expanding my knowledge of css, I recently finished a project using Tailwind (see the pinned RocketPage).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Angular!
- ðŸ¤“ Fun facts: Hobbies include being a film nerd, running goal this year is to run a half-marathon in under two hours, reading, chess, piano, Rocket League, and Fantasy English Premier League! COYG! 

Thanks for reading!
